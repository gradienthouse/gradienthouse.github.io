                    This project seamlessly integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT API with WordPress, automating content creation and uploads. By connecting with ChatGPT, the program autonomously generates articles based on enhanced prompts, which are enriched with web-scraped data. This innovation not only streamlines the content creation process but also optimizes content management workflows, reducing manual intervention. The result is a time-efficient, sustainable solution for regular blogging, pushing the boundaries of AI-powered digital content management.

                    Customer Churn Prediction was a project for a Polish bank. Given historical data, we developed a time-series model for predicting if a client will likely churn in the following month.
                    During development, we found out that the task given by the bank was vague and that more valuable data could be collected. We recommended future actions (such as A/B testing) and suggested developing a different, personalized activity metric that would tell the bank more about customer engagement.
                    We also developed a customer clustering system to aid the marketing department with choosing a personalized communication strategy.
                    The technological stack consisted of Google Cloud Platform solutions, such as VertexAI and Compute Engine.

                    Using deep learning, we successfully developed a model that aids in the identification of novel drugs capable of combating SARS-CoV-2, by discovering new enzyme inhibitors.
                    The aim of this work was to identify potential inhibitors of the Nsp-13 protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using an approach based on deep learning.
                    The input for training the neural network was a set of protein-ligand pairs. The output was a probability of a ligand-protein pair having an IC50 value < 10 Î¼M, which creates possibility that given ligand is an inhibitor.
                    In the end the prediction resulted in an accuracy of 86%, precision of 95% and recall of 88%.
                    Four out of five analyzed proteins showed a noticeable difference between the results of docking ligands labeled as promising and those from the bottom of the list returned by the neural network.
